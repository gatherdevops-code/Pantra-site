                <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    By accessing or using Pantra's services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. 
                    If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the service.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Use License</h2>
                <p>
                    Permission is granted to temporarily use Pantra for personal or commercial purposes. This is the 
                    grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

                <ul>
                    <li>Modify or copy the materials</li>
                    <li>Use the materials for any commercial purpose without authorization</li>
                    <li>Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in Pantra</li>
                    <li>Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials</li>
                    <li>Transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
                <p>

                    and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result 
                    in immediate termination of your account on our Service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any 
                    activities or actions under your password.

                    <li>In any way that infringes upon the rights of others, or in any way is illegal, threatening, fraudulent, or harmful</li>
                    <li>To engage in any other conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment of the Service</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
